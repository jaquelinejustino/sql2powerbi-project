#SQL to Power BI 

---

Welcome to this portfolio project! 🚀

This end-to-end solution demonstrates my ability to design and implement a complete data pipeline — from SQL-based data modeling and data warehouse development to interactive dashboard creation in Power BI.
It follows industry best practices in data engineering, modeling (star schema), and business intelligence, with a focus on delivering insights that support decision-making.
The goal is to showcase my technical skills and analytical thinking in real-world business scenarios.

🏗️ Data Architecture

The project applies the Medallion Architecture framework — organizing data across Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers to ensure scalability, quality, and clarity throughout the pipeline:

▪︎ **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw, unprocessed data ingested from CSV files into a SQL Server database.
▪︎ **Silver Layer**: Applies data cleansing, normalization, and standardization, preparing data for reliable downstream use.
▪︎ **Gold Layer**: Contains curated, business-ready data modeled in a star schema, optimized for reporting and analytics.

This project showcases the full data lifecycle, combining technical execution with strategic thinking:

▪︎ **Modern Data Architecture**: Designing and implementing a Medallion-based warehouse to organize and govern data effectively.
▪︎ **ETL Development**: Building robust ETL processes to extract, transform, and load data into the SQL Server database.
▪︎ **Dimensional Modeling**: Creating fact and dimension tables following star schema principles for performance and usability.
▪︎ **Data Analysis & Reporting**: Delivering actionable insights through Power BI dashboards supported by DAX measures and SQL queries.
