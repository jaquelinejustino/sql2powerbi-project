#SQL to Power BI Project

Welcome to this portfolio project! üöÄ

This end-to-end solution demonstrates my ability to design and implement a complete data pipeline from SQL-based data modeling and data warehouse development to interactive dashboard creation in Power BI.
It follows industry best practices in data engineering, modeling (star schema), and business intelligence, with a focus on delivering insights that support decision-making.
The goal is to showcase my technical skills and analytical thinking in real-world business scenarios.

##üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture

The project applies the Medallion Architecture framework organizing data across *Bronze*, *Silver*, and *Gold* layers to ensure scalability, quality, and clarity throughout the pipeline:

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw, unprocessed data ingested from CSV files into a SQL Server database.
2. **Silver Layer**: Applies data cleansing, normalization, and standardization, preparing data for reliable downstream use.
3. **Gold Layer**: Contains curated, business-ready data modeled in a star schema, optimized for reporting and analytics.
